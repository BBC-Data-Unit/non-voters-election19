# General Election 2019: The untapped influence of the non-voter

In November 2019, ahead of the 2019 General Election, **Dan Wainwright** [analysed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50393317) turnout in the 2017 election, finding that in 8 out of 10 constituencies there were more non-voters than the winning MP's majority.

The effect was that had they all voted for the second placed candidate, rather than stayed away, the outcome would have changed.

In one in six constituencies there were more non-voters than people who voted for the winner.

The data came from the Electoral Commission.

We counted the total turnout, meaning that spoiled and rejected papers were counted among the "voters" rather than the non-voters as these people did still attend and do something with their paper.
